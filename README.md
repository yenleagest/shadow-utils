# shadow-utils

A simplified extraction of [Selenide's](https://selenide.org) internal logic for interacting with shadow DOM elements using deep CSS traversal.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- âœ… Shadow DOM support with `::shadow` / `>>>` / `/deep/`-like behavior
- âœ… Custom locator logic for working across nested shadow roots
- âœ… Minimal dependency footprint (Selenide-based)
- âœ… Designed for integration testing in modern web apps

## ðŸ§© Why?

Modern frontend frameworks (like Lit, Stencil, or even raw Web Components) use **Shadow DOM**, which encapsulates elements and prevents access via regular CSS selectors.  
This utility helps you **pierce the shadow boundaries** cleanly in your Selenide tests.
